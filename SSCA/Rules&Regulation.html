			school before school bell. Any student coming after the school bell

			or lost by the students. Do emphasise to your child to take care of

			property, books or other equipment will be fined and the loss will 
			have to be made by the concerned parents.</font></p>

			Please pick and drop your child (specially in junior campus) from 
			the school's gate. Please do not rush the school's gate keeper at 
			the end of the day and allow him to perform his duties effectively.

			accordance with the records in the school's General Register. Any 
			student absent from school for one calendar month without a note of

			<b><font style="font-size: 13pt">School Uniform</font></b><font style="font-size: 13pt"><br>
			Uniforms give students a sense of pride and belonging in their 
			school. Students are expected to attend school in a neat, tidy and 
			clean prescribed school uniform only. Summer uniform is to be worn 
			from April to October. Winter uniform is to be worm from November to 
			March. As parents you spend a lot of money in sending your child to 
			school each day dressed smartly in their uniform. Sadly, every week 
			we have a pile of lost property which we cannot always match to a 
			child.<br>
			Putting your child's name on all items of clothing would help avoid 
			such mishaps for your child.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
			<b><font style="font-size: 13pt">Attire and Appearance</font></b><font style="font-size: 13pt"><br>

			simple ear studs. School cannot take responsibility for any lost 
			items of jewellery.<br>
			Black plains clips, hair hands or hair ribbons are allowed as hair 
			accessories for girls. Plain brown belts without big buckles are 
			allowed for boys.<br>
			Students are allowed to wear plain black wrist watches only and they 
			are advises not to wear strong fragrance or perfumes. Hair should be 
			kept clean and free from nits and lice. Students with lice infection 
			will not be allowed to attend school unless their hair is clean. 
			Nails should be cut regularly to keep them short and clean. Students 
			should carry paper tissues or handkerchiefs in their pockets 
			regularly.</font></p>
		<p align="left">
			<b><font style="font-size: 13pt">School Discipline</font></b><font style="font-size: 13pt"><br>
			It is our aim to teach our students to work in a friendly and 
			cooperative environment with each other. Being courteous and 
			considerate however starts from home and children should be 
			encouraged of this also. This is also recognised and rewarded with 5 
			marks in every bi-monthly.<br>
			Mid and final examination for discipline and behavior. Students or 
			their parents found accused of disobeying discipline, harassing or 
			misbehaving with schools staff, other students or parents will no 
			longer continue with this school. SSCA has a very strict and clear 
			policy regarding safely of its property and people concerned. Any

			<b><font style="font-size: 13pt">Complaints Procedure</font></b><font style="font-size: 13pt"><br>
			At school we make many decisions every day. We try hard to do our 
			best for all our pupils. We like to know when things are going well, 
			but we also want parents to tell us about their worries, concerns or 
			complaints as soon as possible.<br>

			occurred to ensure the matter can be dealt with. Telephonic 
			complaints and long conversation will not be entertained by the 
			principal, or teachers.<br>

			relevant campus head. In case, if you feel that your complaint has 
			not been reviewed properly then you can also submit your complaints 
			in written format through the complaint box available in every 
			campus. The management will always try to resolve difficulties or 
			complaints at the earliest possible stage through discussion with 
			the relevant parties. For any such matter please seek an 
			appointment.<br>
			In case of emergency, parents should never hesitate to come and see 
			the principal.<br>
			Parents sitting at the Reception Office should not discuss their 
			problems or complaints with other people.<br>

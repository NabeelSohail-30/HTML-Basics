3. <mark>Plural and Possessive Nouns</mark>
<h3><i>Noun Identification</i></h3>
<b>What is a noun?</b><strong> A noun is a person,</strong> place, thing, quality, animal, idea or activity.
<br><br>
<small>For example:</small>
<br>
Person — Maria
<br>
Place — Detroit
<br>
Thing — Desk
<br>
Quality — Width
<br>
Animal — Dog
<br>
Idea — Independence
<br>
Activity — Navigation
<br><br><br>
Spot the nouns in a sentence: Maria went into the city to purchase detergent.
<br><br>
Nouns: Person — Maria
<br>
Place — City
<br>
Thing — Detergent
<h3>The functions of nouns</h3>
Nouns sometimes function differently in sentences. For example:
<br>
Subject: Maria likes ice cream
<br>
Object of Preposition: &#160;&#160;&#160;He gave the ice cream to Maria
<br>
Subject complement: The best customer is Maria
<p align="justify">Grammar vocabulary: " &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nominal means any word&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;", or group of words, used as a noun. The nominal word used in the original noun example is Maria.</p>
<h3>Types of Nouns</h3>
<q>The names of specific things, places, and people</q>, like Maria or Detroit, are Proper nouns.
<br><br>
General, colloquial names, like table or house are Common nouns. Common nouns can either be concrete​ or abstract.
<br><br>
When an object is concrete i.e. you can see it and touch it, like a phone or a chair, it is a Concrete noun.
<br><br>
When it is a quality or idea, like freedom or justice, it is an Abstract noun.
<h3>Count Nouns</h3>
<blockquote cite="http://cnn.com">Count nouns are anything that can be counted.They are singular or plural. Plurals usually end with “s.”Count nouns are anything that can be counted.They are singular or plural. Plurals usually end with “s.”
<h1>Count Noun Defination</h1><p>Count nouns are anything that can be counted.They are singular or plural. Plurals usually end with “s.”Count nouns are anything that can be counted.</p>They are singular or plural. Plurals usually end with “s.”</blockquote>

<br><br>
Mass Nouns are nouns that cannot be counted and they usually do not have a plural form
<br><br>
Examples: Freedom, sand, money
<br><br>
Collective nouns refer to groups of people and/or things. Unlike mass nouns, they can usually be counted, so they usually have plural forms.
<br><br>
Examples:
<br><br>
Singular — Staff
<br>
Plural — Staffs
<br><br>
Singular — Herd
<br>
Plural — Herds
<br><br><br>

<h3>Plural Nouns</h3>
<p>
Plural nouns are the nouns that have been changed into their plural states by adding -s or -es. Remember your irregular nouns, such as mice and children! They too are plural nouns.
</p>
<h3>Possessive Nouns</h3>
Nouns can be possessive and express ownership, usually following the use of “of.”
<br><br>
Example: The life of Maria
<br><br>
Most singular possessives are formed by adding an apostrophe and “s.” If the noun is plural, the possessive form becomes “s” and apostrophe.
<br><br>
Singular Common: Dog
<br>
Singular Possessive: Dog’s
<br>
Plural Common: Dogs
<br>
Plural Possessive: Dogs
<br><br>
Exception: if the plural noun does not end with an “s,” the possessive is formed by adding an ​apostrophe and “s.”
<br><br>
Example:
<br><br>
Singular Common: Woman
<br>
Singular Possessive: Woman’s
<br>
Plural Common: Women
<br>
Plural Possessive: Women’s

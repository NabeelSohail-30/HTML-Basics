<br>
3. Plural and Possessive Nouns
<h3>Noun Identification</h3>
What is a noun? A noun is a person, place, thing, quality, animal, idea or activity.
<br><br>
For example:
<br>
Person — Maria
<br>
Place — Detroit
<br>
Thing — Desk
<br>
Quality — Width
<br>
Animal — Dog
<br>
Idea — Independence
<br>
Activity — Navigation
<br><br><br>
Spot the nouns in a sentence: Maria went into the city to purchase detergent.
<br><br>
Nouns: Person — Maria
<br>
Place — City
<br>
Thing — Detergent
<h3>The functions of nouns</h3>
Nouns sometimes function differently in sentences. For example:
<br>
Subject: Maria likes ice cream
<br>
Object of Preposition: He gave the ice cream to Maria
<br>
Subject complement: The best customer is Maria
<p>Grammar vocabulary: Nominal means any word, or group of words, used as a noun. The nominal word used in the original noun example is Maria.</p>
<h3>Types of Nouns</h3>
The names of specific things, places, and people, like Maria or Detroit, are Proper nouns.
<br><br>
General, colloquial names, like table or house are Common nouns. Common nouns can either be concrete​ or abstract.
<br><br>
When an object is concrete i.e. you can see it and touch it, like a phone or a chair, it is a Concrete noun.
<br><br>
When it is a quality or idea, like freedom or justice, it is an Abstract noun.
<h3>Count Nouns</h3>
Count nouns are anything that can be counted. They are singular or plural. Plurals usually end with “s.”
<br><br>
Singular — Car
<br>
Plural — Cars
<br><br>
Singular — Chair
<br>
Plural — Chairs
<br><br>
Singular — Dog
<br>
Plural — Dogs
<br><br>
Irregular Examples
<br><br>
Singular — Mouse
<br>
Plural — Mice
<br><br>
Singular — Child
<br>
Plural — Children
<br><br>
Most nouns ending in s, sh, o, or ch need an -es suffix to be plural
<br><br>
Singular — Bus
<br>
Plural — Buses
<br><br>
Singular — Dish
<br>
Plural — Dishes
<br><br>
Singular — Potato
<br>
Plural — Potatoes
<br><br>
Singular — Church
<br>
Plural — Churches
<br><br>
Nouns ending in a consonant followed by y become plural by changing the y to i and adding -es
<br><br>
Singular — Mystery
<br>
Plural — Mysteries
<br><br>
Mass Nouns are nouns that cannot be counted and they usually do not have a plural form
<br><br>
Examples: Freedom, sand, money
<br><br>
Collective nouns refer to groups of people and/or things. Unlike mass nouns, they can usually be counted, so they usually have plural forms.
<br><br>
Examples:
<br><br>
Singular — Staff
<br>
Plural — Staffs
<br><br>
Singular — Herd
<br>
Plural — Herds
<br><br><br>
<h3>Plural Nouns</h3>
<p>
Plural nouns are the nouns that have been changed into their plural states by adding -s or -es. Remember your irregular nouns, such as mice and children! They too are plural nouns.
</p>
<h3>Possessive Nouns</h3>
Nouns can be possessive and express ownership, usually following the use of “of.”
<br><br>
Example: The life of Maria
<br><br>
Most singular possessives are formed by adding an apostrophe and “s.” If the noun is plural, the possessive form becomes “s” and apostrophe.
<br><br>
Singular Common: Dog
<br>
Singular Possessive: Dog’s
<br>
Plural Common: Dogs
<br>
Plural Possessive: Dogs
<br><br>
Exception: if the plural noun does not end with an “s,” the possessive is formed by adding an ​apostrophe and “s.”
<br><br>
Example:
<br><br>
Singular Common: Woman
<br>
Singular Possessive: Woman’s
<br>
Plural Common: Women
<br>
Plural Possessive: Women’s
